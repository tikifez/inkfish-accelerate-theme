# ðŸ¦‘ðŸ’¨ Inkfish Accelerate 

Inkfish Accelerate is an experimental block-based theme for WordPress utilizing
[full site editing](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/focuses/full-site-editing/). 
Goals include implementing block-based themes with semantic HTML, meeting a11y 
and i18n concerns, and overall ease-of-use.

## Requirements

For now, the [Gutenberg plugin](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg)
is required to enable this theme, but full site editing is planned for [release 
in WP core](https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2021/01/21/big-picture-goals-2021/) 
in v5.8.
