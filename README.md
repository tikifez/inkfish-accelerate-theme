Inkfish Accelerate is an experimental block-based theme for WordPress utilizing
full site editing. For now, the [Gutenberg plugin](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg)
is required to enable this theme, but full site editing is planned for release 
in WP core in v5.8.

Many thanks to the WordPress team and especially the contributors to the 
contributors to the WordPress [theme experiments](https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments).
